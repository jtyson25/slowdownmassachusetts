This repository contains code for a website, graphics, and some of the datasets used to create those graphics for a sample MassDOT PSA. This represents my submission for the summer 2024 internship at The Lab @ MassDOT.

The "R Work" folder includes my R code and part of the data (limited by enormous file sizes!). The rest of the repository is for the website.
